Considerations:

1. A Postgres database calles "app_insurance" must be created manually.
2. An Environment Variable called "DATABASE_URI" must be created with the value of you postgres connection motor.

Uncoming updates:

1. March 14th 2023: The rest of the CRUD endpoints are going to be added. ----> Completed

2. March 20th 2023: Start checking the Business GET endpoint for getting a business by ID because the endpoint is not working, seems that is not receiving correctly the information from the form which is written in the macros, justo to remind you Damian of the future ;)
